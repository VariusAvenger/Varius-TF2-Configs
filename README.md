# Varius-TF2-Configs
My personal class-specific configs and in-game settings. 

Create a folder inside of tf/cfg titled 'user' without the quotations. Paste all of the .cfg files into this new folder. 
If done correctly, you can use everything here with mastercomfig without having to edit anything further. 

All of my key binds are located in 'reset.cfg' and appear nowhere else which makes editing anything a very quick and easy process. 
Editing aliases can be done easily in both the Autoexec (for more core gameplay specific stuff) and then the class.cfg files (for class specific stuff).
